# CPlusPlusProgram
Creating a repository for CS210

-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  To read a list of groceries using Python and display options based on menu inputs using C++.
  
-What did you do particularly well?
  I believe that having the code be very simple but yet feature rich beyond the assignment requirements is what I did well.
  
-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Having the .dat file actually be exportable and incorperating both the list and the histogram is what I would work on changing first.
  
-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Having the Python code play nice and incorporate into the C++ code was the most challenging. I would get different errors but used a combintation of problem solving,     and research allowed me to overcome the obstacles.
  
-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Ingrating different langauges into one program and leveraging the benefits of them. 
  
-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By using best practices of using whitespace effectively, removing redundent code, and making use of comments.
